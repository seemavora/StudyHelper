hello is that dr pi? yeah speaking, can you get us 
some transcripts from youtube? transcripts? yeah  
okay I can do that! we will be awfully grateful 
if you can do this lovely job all right thank you
hello everybody in this video we're going 
to look at how to get the transcript of a  
youtube video automatically so we're going to be 
using python code to do this so let's look at how  
we're going to get about it so firstly we want 
to get the id of the youtube video so the id is  
the last part of the url of the video that you're 
watching that you want to get the transcript from  
next we want to uh we want to add the id to our 
python code and once we've done that we can then  
pass the output and we can save it to a text 
file or we can do some NLP with it if we want so  
we've all got our own reasons for passing and 
for actually extracting the transcript anyway um  
obviously there's manual ways of doing this 
and there are browser extensions but we want  
to do this programmatically and also we 
may want to do it for many many videos  
so you don't want to sit there keep clicking 
right clicking copy and pasting and so on so
as i said the part of the i part 
of the url which represents the id  
which you will need to get is this so after the 
equals and there's a little gotcha actually which  
i'll show you in the code in a minute where 
if it begins if it begins with a backslash  
so that's what you need to do and once you've got 
the video id then it's time to install pip install  
youtube dash transcript dash api and if you're 
doing it the normal old-fashioned way pip install  
youtube underscore transcript underscore api or 
if you're using conda conda install c conda dash  
forge youtube dash transcript dash api so when you 
do it on conda you've just got hyphens instead of  
underscores this is the conda page it was last 
updated three months ago so it's very recent  
it's quite a new project actually only 248 
downloads anyway when you've installed it  
or when you want to install it using conda you'll 
get a screen like this and it'll prompt you that  
you need to uh update or install the following 
packages ca certificates certified and conda  
and just say yes to agree to these they're quite 
small um right this is the this is a screenshot of  
the of the uh the the this is a screenshot of the 
documentation couldn't get my words out then not  
getting seen honestly it's just uh like a coffee 
right from youtube underscore transcript api  
import use youtube transcript api so just copy and 
paste that from the documentation then this is the  
good bit youtube youtube transcript api dot get 
underscore transcript and then a brackets video id  
so there's no um there's no quotes or anything for 
that so just paste it straight into the brackets  
and if you were to copy what they've shown 
here you would actually just get a large  
um large python dictionary insert or multiple 
python dictionaries inside the list so  
in a minute i'll show you some code and 
i'll show you how to actually extract that  
if you want different languages you 
can specify different languages so  
what it does is actually checks in sequence so 
it will check if you put d e then it will check  
for a german transcript first and then english 
and so on and so on so you can put many many  
different flavors there and uh yeah it will 
try and get the one that you want in sequence  
in order of priority um right so this is some 
code this is what we will get when we run it so  
this is just a little taster and if you like 
this code or if you like the projects rather  
um then donate if possible to jonas de poire at 
web dot d e uh go to the go to the documentation  
and you will see his donate button there and 
if you like what i do then don't forget to  
check out red and green which is my website and 
there's links to various different things we got  
a bit of network automation my github page my 
blog where i just put a few technical notes  
rather than more than a few even data 
extraction challenges using jquery  
and working with json and apis and there we 
go so if you'd like to see some actual code  
okay so we've done the conda install we've 
installed youtube transcript api if you want to do  
it with pip then you don't need to do the cond a 
bit so this is where we do the import the module  
from youtube transcript api import youtube 
transcript api then um just a quick note here  
you can have a list of just a couple of settings 
so as i mentioned just now this is a note about  
the language settings and um also with regard to 
the video id if the video id starts with a hyphen  
you'll have to mask the hyphen using the
backslash so yeah if it's got a hyphen at the 
start you just need to put a backslash otherwise  
the uh the code will think that it's an 
argument or think it's an argument name  
so the main code if you're ready to see 
that well i've already got an extracted  
video id so all i've done is just found a 
video i found one that had subtitles and  
if it doesn't have subtitles you're getting 
that or you won't get an error but you'll  
get a notification saying that it it's not 
possible to get subtitles for this video  
so the main code out ls so that's going to be 
the list which captures the output of all of the  
subtitles so tx equals youtube transcripts 
api dot get trans get underscore transcript  
and there we can see um the parameters that you 
pass to it so you can pass to the video id the  
languages and it can also cope with proxies and 
cookies the default is no proxy and no cookies  
so the default is also english if you don't 
specify languages either so i could actually  
leave that out well i'm just for demonstration 
purposes i'm going to leave d e in here  
and you'll see what happens because when d 
e is not available it will then just go off  
and get english um be aware that these are two 
letter country codes uh what was i using the other  
day something was using three-letter country 
codes i think that may have been i don't know  
was it ginger something like that not not ginger 
itself but uh something i was doing with ginger  
um for i in tx so for so the object which youtube 
transcript api dot gets i've just called tx so  
for each item in that object so it's basically 
returning a list for each item in that list  
um we want to do this so this is the bit 
that you wouldn't see on the documentation  
and this is the bit that actually picks out the 
text if you don't do this you'll end up with  
a json dictionary and you'll end up with start 
times end times um and so on it won't provide you  
with what you need if you're planning on working 
with just the actual text for instance if you're  
about to do something with nlp um maybe it's not 
sentiment analysis well maybe sentiment analysis  
um you may be creating a bag of words analyzing 
part of speech etc etc so uh what we've got here  
is text so we're just like putting one line of 
text and then we're going to append it to our list  
and um also what i'm going to do is open a 
new file or append and then i'm going to write  
the text from the current line as we go 
through the video so obviously the video runs  
that way because of the timings so as we go 
through time we keep getting a new line a new  
line a new line new line new line so and that's 
why i've put new line here without the new line  
you just end up with a massive long you just 
imagine 40 minute video just with one line of text  
not good right then all i've done in it just 
for um a little bit of a bonus i've added in  
chrome sklearn feature extraction 
just added in account vectorizer  
and it converts a collection of text 
documents to a matrix of token accounts  
and yeah from here you could go and do 
your own thing with um yeah nlp and so on  
you could even reject the video if it didn't 
have a certain phrase so you could go off  
and get subtitles from many many videos 
and rather than watching um 20 videos on
climate change you could get the 
20 transcripts and then you could  
you could just search each of those 
transcripts for certain words such as  
polar bear maybe only three of those videos have 
got the word polar bear so rather than watching  
20 videos you then know that you've only got to 
watch those three videos so this isn't all about  
hacking or web scraping or doing anything naughty 
it can be used purely to save your time and  
i know youtube would probably like you to watch 
20 20 videos that all last an hour long but um  
i think they would still be happy if you're only 
watching three videos they're an hour long each  
you know three hours is better than nothing um and 
you probably wouldn't sit down and watch 20 hours  
worth of videos anyway so you then what would 
you do i don't know you'd probably just go off  
and read a book so with that all that being said 
i think it's time to actually demonstrate the code  
so what i'm just going to do is just i'll just 
comment that comment out this bit for starters  
and what we'll do is we will just run the main 
code which should just generate us a text file  
so if i just bring up the sidebar 
and you see i've already run it once  
so let's just delete that text 
file and um yeah let's run it so
it's run and that was when i um run my code within 
vs code it sends all this output to the screen  
um and it runs successfully no 
error message and i know it runs  
successfully because i've got that op 
text file back and let's have a look so
hi everyone welcome to this lecture series 
on osi i file storage service and in this  
particular module we're going to introduce 
the file storage service and look at it  
some of its characteristics my name is ryan i'm 
part of the oracle cloud infrastructure team  
so that's pretty good i mean there's 
very few kind of um errors there  
last week i was adding subtitles to my videos 
about ginger and that's obviously j-i-n-j-a and  
yeah the subtitles were just calling it ginger as 
in g-i-n-g-e-r and had to change that everywhere  
ginger obviously being a plant or a flavor flavor 
of biscuits right so that is the output file which  
um yeah okay so so far so good before we run let's 
just delete that and i'll run that on it let's  
just uh test it on them on a different come on 
delete i've made the font really big and it's um  
made it a bit harder to do 
what i normally do so um
right okay so let's just get um 
another youtube video youtube
and anyone got any requests
um
tell you what let's do one of my videos so if 
you let's just um there's two ways of doing it  
so what the an easy way to actually get it 
is just to click share and then just go in  
here and that's the video id there so um i said 
it was easy there you go right right click copy  
and um let's replace what i had in here 
before with my new video id so there we go  
and this should work because i have done 
the subtitles for it so if we run it
may take a while wow that was only about 
what two seconds and um wow because  
that's interesting i've actually enabled german 
subtitles on my on my most recent videos and  
it's actually gone off and got the german and 
i think there's some characters missing from  
the whether it is i think it's 
probably missing the on lives  
so you you've got the german translation there 
because it tries german first uh if i take  
out german from there it will just obviously 
just get the english so i'm gonna delete that  
run it one more time just to 
prove that it does multi language  
and um well it's even got i don't 
know why it's putting this in here
oh it's not liking the new line characters is it
maybe
don't know that's um
in fact let's just open that with uh
let's just open that with a different text editor 
shall we i'm just going to open that with um
let's just open it with word pud  
this is uh i'm back on the windows machine 
because i'm i've been having some issues with  
flickering on the screen using um my linux mint 
and obs so here we go yeah hello everybody today  
we're looking at how to scrape videos content 
from youtube so what i mean is we're going to  
download the video so yeah technically you could 
call it scraping if you want or scrapping if  
yeah don't get me started on scrapping 
so um this is just how it's rendered in  
vs code so don't worry about that it opens 
fine in a text editor a normal text editor  
so there we go and um right who wants to just run 
a little bit of natural language process well it's  
not we're not really doing anything clever all 
we're just doing is we're running count vectorizer  
which will um creates vectorizer 
object and then it prints you  
identified unique words along with their indices 
so um let's just run that and that'll print to  
the screen so there we go that's all the 
unique words uh with their indices so
if we wanted we could check this text for 
a certain word um we could check it for
scraping
scrape scraping
so there we go i hope this has been interesting um 
the whole reason i made this video was because i  
had a subscriber ask if following on from 
the previous videos where i've extracted  
text from uh from the images created from uh 
stills taken from the video the subscriber said  
could i extract the transcripts programmatically 
and obviously this is it this is the solution so
youtube transcript api and the benefit or 
the beauty of it is you don't even need to  
register for an api key and an auth token and 
so on this is this is usable on any video so um  
yeah obviously youtube haven't um blocked 
it or anything so um i know there's a bit  
about proxies and so on but um for all intents and 
purposes that's that's not needed here not in this  
example or not from the uk so perhaps if you're 
trying to access this from china or somewhere  
maybe you need to use proxy i don't know um but 
there we go so hopefully you've enjoyed this  
and found it useful don't forget to as usual 
subscribe thumbs up um because of the algos thank
you
do you really understand NLP by the end
of this video no matter what your
understanding of neuro linguistic
programming is I can assure you it's
going to be a lot better keep watching
this is life mastery gym I'm Damon Cart
and I teach people just like you cutting
edge NLP processes and techniques so
that you can master your life and take
charge of your destiny so if that sounds
good make sure you click subscribe to
this YouTube channel so you can get
these videos on a regular basis maybe
you've read an an Opie book or maybe
you've even done an NLP training but if
you had to explain what nor linguistic
programming is to someone else who's
never heard of it how well can you do
that most people can't do it very well
by the end of this video though you will
have a very solid and basic
understanding of NLP well enough that
you can explain it to someone else and
that's really the marker to truly know
that you get NLP what I've learned over
the years that everything that you need
to understand about NLP to be truly
effective with it is found in the basics
a lot of people try to jump to the newer
technology and new advancements or
advanced trainings but if you don't have
the basics down none of that other stuff
really will do much for you make sure
you stay tuned to the end of this video
because at the end I'm going to show you
a way that you can take your NLP
understandings even deeper with some
free training I've already made several
videos about what NLP is so if you want
more of an explanation other than just
this video go ahead and search my
channel you'll find several more and
I'll link some to a playlist in this
video so the point of this video is not
to repeat myself the point of this video
is to give you a new and fresh
understanding so again if you feel like
you already know or really have a solid
understanding of NLP this video should
still help you also I'm curious about
you how well do you feel like your
understanding of NLP is if you feel like
you have a very solid understanding or
if you felt you don't feel like you
much of an understanding of it at all
let me know in the comments below I
think the most important understanding
not just about NLP is about your life
and in NLP that's what we're focused on
is your experience of your life so the
most important understanding is
understanding that your life is
subjective now what do I mean by that it
means that there's no way that you could
possibly know objective reality that
everything that you're experiencing is
as subjective and that word itself
experience is it means that your it is
subjective because your experience is
your experience and then everyone else's
experiences or their experience but you
can't experience something without it
being an experience so I think just kind
of goes in a loop on top of itself over
and over that what you're experiencing
is an experience now in NLP they say
that NOP is a study of the structure of
subjective experience and later in a
book
John Grenier said well you know we could
have left out the subjective because
experience is subjective there is no
such thing as having an objective
experience we can study things like we
do in science and we can try it as much
as possible to find some sort of
objective truth about what it is that
we're studying but we can never ever get
beyond the fact that even the
interpretation of that objective
information or that objective truth has
to pass through our subject of
subjective senses and our subjective
filters like our beliefs and our
thoughts about what it is that we're
interpreting so this is how it is
possible that two people or more can
look at the same set of facts but create
totally different interpretations of it
totally different meanings of it or draw
different conclusions or and even make
different categories for it an
understanding this that your life is a
subjective experience that opens many
many doors and many many opportunities
to create the life experience that you
want to have and that's what NLP is
really all about and how we do that is
through
Modelling so if someone is having a an
experience of life that you want say
that they're happy they're successful
they're doing things that that you want
to be doing well within Opia as we go to
the structure of this we don't go to
that person and say how exactly are you
so happy how exactly are you successful
not that we wouldn't answer asked that
question but that's not we're not
looking for the content because if you
went and asked today Einstein if you
were still alive how did you become so
smart well he could probably tell you
how he thinks he became so smart but he
wouldn't actually know there's not a way
that you can actually know a lot of the
things that you are able to do well or
even the things that you're not able to
do well they sort of just happened and
then in retrospect we can go back and
say well I think this is why or this you
know this happened but what we do in NLP
is we go to the structure we go - well
what's actually happening what is the
sensory input that you're getting and
how is that sensory input categorize how
- how is that sensory input selected or
how is it interpreted that's how we're
looking at the world and how we're
looking at a person's experience is what
is that structure that creates that it
can only be based in sensory based
experience because we're not going into
the content the why the the the reasons
we think that these things have occurred
we're going to the structure of them so
to summarize this first understanding
just know that your experience of your
life is subjective the good part about
that is that your life is not unchanging
you can change your life by
understanding how you're structuring it
internally which is mostly unconscious
so when you really understand that your
life your experience of your life and
you are all in a subjective experience
then just from that understanding alone
you become more flexible you become more
malleable now all you need to learn is
how this structure works there are many
parts to the structure and again all of
this that I'm talking about all of these
points that I'm talking about can be
expanded into entire trainings on their
own but we're going to
we're gonna keep to the larger chunks
the broader strokes and that's why I
want to talk about beliefs beliefs are
the most powerful filters that you have
in your life because what you believe
then tends to create your life
experience and what you believe about
yourself is has the greatest effect on
what creates your reality so what I'm
pointing at is your sense of self your
self-concept now you can have beliefs
about the world and the limitation you
can have limiting beliefs about the
world and yes that will affect you but
your limiting beliefs are your
empowering beliefs about yourself are
going to have the greatest effect on
your entire life within LP we learn how
we create these structures that we call
beliefs we often refer to them in NLP as
generalizations so when you understand
how you create generalizations
especially the ones you make about
yourself then you can change it so yes
you can literally change yourself in
moments by understanding how you create
the beliefs you have about yourself and
changing them so of course we want to
take limiting beliefs and change them
into empowering beliefs especially at
the direction of what it is that we
desire or whatever it is that we
envision about what we want our life to
be like so when you understand all of
this which is a lot here what I'm
talking about it's eliciting your values
around what you want and then it's
understanding what do you believe about
that but more importantly what do you
believe about yourself because what you
believe about yourself like I said has
the greatest effect on what you
experience in your reality so understand
that and then your life can really
change when you start changing these
beliefs so to summarize what NLP
actually is it's about learning that
structure of your experience that
subjective structure and we do that
through language we do that through the
five senses and we do that through
understanding the beliefs that we create
about ourselves and about the world
which we also call generalize a
and all of this is what we're
discovering is how we internally
represent reality because your sense of
reality like I said earlier in the video
is not based on objectivity it's based
on you taking all of this information
that's coming in from around you through
your five senses and internally
representing it and how that process
happens that's the structure that I'm
talking about and yes through learning
NLP you absolutely can understand how
that structure is created and you can
change it one of the things that I like
about NLP the most is that it's not a
Dogma it's not it's not there to tell
you how to live your life or what's the
right way to do things
all it's there to do is to help you
understand how you're creating your life
experience understand that structure so
then you can change it at will and
ultimately create the experiences in
life that you want to experience and
I'll go even further than that to create
the overall life experience you want to
experience which is how do I want to
experience myself and how do I want to
experience the world around me and it's
a beautiful process because it never
quite ends the more you learn the more
you change things the more you improve
your life the more potential you see to
do that and NLP has the the tools work
consistently no matter where you are in
your life no matter how down you are or
how successful you are
NLP tools continue to work and I've been
doing this for several years now so a
prime example but I'm not the only one
there are several people in this world
who just continue to use NLP tools to
improve their lives the experience of
life that you want to live so now you
know some basic understandings of NLP
but what you don't know is how to
directly apply it in your life I was
talking in very broad strokes and and
generalizations so if you want to go
deeper with this I've created a
four-part video series where I go more
in depth about direct applications using
NLP and you can get this free training
by going to the description right down
below you'll see a link you can click on
that link and then also I put a link in
the
a comments section right down there is
the pen comment so just click on that
link and you'll get immediate access to
the first video and then it'll be
followed by a video every single day for
the next few days so what are you going
to do now with these understandings
these understandings are rather
universal and you can just go deeper and
deeper with them and again they are
basic understandings but like I said you
there is no into the depths of going
into this you can continue to explore
your life and yourself throughout your
entire life and in the process and prove
it every step of the way so what are you
going to do now let me know in the
