  text: ` We know that our brain is what makes us ‘us”. It's what processes all the sensory input from the outside world and creates this reality in our brain that we experience . So the question is What is the brain actually made up of? And it's primarily made up . of neurons . And it’s by these different neurons triggering, by getting excited and stimulating other neurons . Researchers have taught us that our brains are actually a lot like a muscle . We know that you can grow your muscles by going into the gym and doing exercise and straining your muscles . By struggling it's a signal to your body to devote more resources to that part of the body . And we see that exact same thing with the brain . By age 6 you have a much deeper and much stronger connectedness between the different neurons . The more you use it, the stronger gets and that the best way to grow it isn't to do things that are easy for you that might help a little bit . The big takeaway from this whole area of research is you absolutely can change your intelligence that your brain is like a muscle . What really helps your brain is when you struggle with things and actually research shows that your brain grows the most not when you get a question “right” but when you answer it wrong . So at least for me this is incredibly exciting because it lets me know that when I'm going through something and I'm facing those times of maybe a little bit of adversity .`,
